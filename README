= MCMClib: a C library for decent speed MCMC =

MCMClib is an object-oriented C library for doing decent speed MCMC. The API is
object-oriented, and should allow for easy binding to higher-level languages.

Undocumented, swig-based bindings to Guile-scheme are provided.

This library is released under the terms of the GPL library, version 3 or
greater.

= Compiling instructions =

~ Dependencies
The GNU Scientific Library, version >= 1.12:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl

~ Build tools
- GNU make
- gcc compiler

~ Compiling
From the toplevel directory, type:

$ make

This will build the static library 'libmcmclib.a' and the shared library
'libmcmclib.so' in the 'src' folder. If you need to tweak the compiler options,
set the environmental variables CFLAGS (passed to the C compiler) and LDFLAGS
(passed to the linker). To customize these variables even more, you can edit the
toplevel `Makefile' direclty.

~ Compiling the guile bindings
In order to compile the guile bindings, you need the GNU guile library:
http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html
installed in your system, version 1.8.x or a compatible one.

To compile the guile bindings, type:

$ make guile

at the shell prompt. If all goes right, in the 'guile' subfolder you will find
all the relevant stuff, ready to be used.
