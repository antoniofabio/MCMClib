In order to use the gsl and MCMClib guile bindings, you have to copy the ".so"
files from the "swig" to a folder in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or in any place where
the 'ld' linker can see them.

Next, you have to place the "swig" and "srfi" folders in your guile load path
(tipically something like /usr/share/guile/1.8), or set it accordingly from within
guile, as it's done at the beginning of the 'main.scm' script.
